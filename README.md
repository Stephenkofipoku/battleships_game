# README BATTLESHIPS GAME

Welcome to the Supper battleships game, a Python terminal game.

## Description
The Battleships game is a classic two-player board game where each player tries to sink the opponent's fleet of ships. Players take turns guessing the coordinates of the opponent's ships on a grid. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game.

## How to Play
- At the start of the game, each player places their ships on their own grid. The ships can be placed vertically or horizontally, but they cannot overlap or go off the grid.
- The game begins with the player and the computer taking turns to make guesses.
- To make a guess, enter the coordinates of the target location on the opponent's grid. For example, to guess the coordinates (1, 3), enter "1,3". The game will validate the input and display the result of the guess.
